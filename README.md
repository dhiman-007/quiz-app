This is a Quiz app, built on Java script and HTML, css. 
I used an Array of Java Script objects that holds Questions, Answers and Correct Answer.
I fetch these Value through a program to render it into HTML DOM.
Then Fetch user responses through Select Ids and created an String by this.
Matched with the String of Correct Answers.
Created an String for Wrong responses to display the right Response and user Answer to make the user More Informatic.
